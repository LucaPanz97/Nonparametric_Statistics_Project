# Nonparametric_Statistics_Project 

# Goal

The goal of this project is to pursue a Nonparametric approach for house pricing in King County, Washington.

Our work unfolds in the following steps:
1. Preprocessing and Outlier Detection: we prepare the data and identify outliers using bagplots based on Tukey depth. This crucial step ensures the integrity of our analysis by using clean and reliable data.
2. Testing Covariate Significance: we investigate the impact of various covariates on house prices. We employ permutational T-tests and permutational ANOVA to determine the significance of these factors, shedding light on what truly drives house prices in this region.
3. Nonparametric Regression Modeling: we employ powerful nonparametric regression techniques. We leverage the flexibility of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with splines to capture complex relationships in the data. Additionally, we explore Robust Regression Models to ensure the stability and accuracy of our predictions.
